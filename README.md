# Red-Black-Tree

A Red Black Tree Program written in C for my MSc course on Data Structures and Algorithms at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.

The focus of this project is to demonstrate core concepts and programming skills that are essential for an embedded software engineering role. A C compiler is necessary to run this program.
